# Stack Implementation Using C++ Template Class
This project demonstrates a stack data structure implemented using a C++ template class.<br>


This project demonstrates a basic stack data structure implemented using a C++ template class. The stack is designed to be generic, supporting various data types, and provides three fundamental operations: **push, pop, and display**. This implementation is ideal for those looking to understand how stacks work and how to utilize C++ templates for creating flexible data structures.

**Features**<br>
**Generic Data Types**: The stack is implemented as a template class, allowing you to store any data type (e.g., int, float, std::string).<br>
**Push Operation**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.<br>
**Pop Operation**: Removes the top element from the stack. An error is thrown if the stack is empty, ensuring safe operation.<br>
**Display Method**: Outputs all elements in the stack from top to bottom, allowing you to visualize the stackâ€™s current state.<br>
